## 📌 General Conclusion

The commercial mortgage case reflects a well-structured, low-risk financing package for a stabilized shopping retail property. With a loan amount of $20 million, a loan-to-value ratio of 63.75%, and a Low Risk (2) rating, the transaction shows strong credit fundamentals.

The client interest rate of 5.50% against a cost of funds of 4.00% yields a 1.50% spread, which is both market-aligned and sustainable for long-term lending. The resulting Risk-Adjusted Return on Capital (RAROC) of 27.0% is comfortably above standard hurdle rates (15–20%), ensuring solid profitability for the lender without overburdening the borrower.
